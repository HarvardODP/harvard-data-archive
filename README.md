# Harvard Data Archive
### Compiled by the Harvard Open Data Project

An extension of HODP's [open data catalog](https://www.hodp.org/data/), which includes a variety of datasets from around the Harvard ecosystem. Some of the sources listed publish recurring reports (daily, monthly, annually), but only keep the most recent years' (or sometimes year's) data up. HODP has attempted to archive and reupload historic files for as many of these reports as possible.
