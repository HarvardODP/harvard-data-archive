# Harvard Data Archive
### Compiled by the Harvard Open Data Project

An extension of HODP's [open data catalog](https://www.hodp.org/data/), which includes a variety of datasets from around the Harvard ecosystem. Some of the sources listed publish recurring reports (daily, monthly, annually), but only keep the most recent years' (or sometimes year's) data up. HODP has attempted to archive and reupload historic files for as many of these reports as possible.

## Notes on Various Datasets
<details>
<summary>HUPD Public Police Logs</summary>
All logs are <strong>unofficial.</strong> Logs from 2010 and earlier were compiled from the <a href="https://huplogs.stalcommpol.org/">Student-Alumni Committee on Institutional Security Policy</a>. From 2002 to mid-way through 2004, these logs are weekly. On August 15th, 2004, the logs switch to being published daily.

Logs from 2024 and later are from <a href="https://www.hupd.harvard.edu/public-police-log">HUPD's Public Police Log</a>. Three months worth of daily logs are listed on this site.
